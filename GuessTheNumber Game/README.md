# Overview

As a software engineer aiming to refine my programming skills and understanding of Java, I embarked on creating a simple yet intriguing game. This game, titled "Single Shot Guess," challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The objective was to craft a program that demonstrates key concepts of Java, such as variables, control structures, data structures, and object-oriented principles.

The purpose of writing this software was to put into practice the fundamental aspects of Java that I've been studying. By building something tangible and interactive, I aimed to deepen my grasp of the language's syntax and features. The game features different difficulty levels to provide a varied experience while including a hidden "Debugger Mode" for development purposes.

# Development Environment

The development of "Single Shot Guess" was carried out in a Java development environment using IntelliJ IDEA as the integrated development environment (IDE). The Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 was used for this project.

The primary programming language for this project is Java. No external libraries were used—only the standard Java libraries provided by the JDK, such as `java.util.Scanner` for input and `java.util.ArrayList` for storing player guesses.

# Useful Websites

The following websites proved invaluable for solving various challenges faced during the development of the game:

* [Oracle Java Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/index.html)
* [Java-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))

# Future Work

The game is in a good place, but like any software, there's always room for improvement. Here's what's next for "Single Shot Guess":

* **Implement Custom Mode** : Allow users to set their range and number of guesses.
* **Inheritance and Interfaces** : Utilize inheritance to create different versions of the game and interfaces to standardize game behavior.
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** : Move beyond the console and develop a GUI for the game using JavaFX or Swing for a more interactive experience.
* **Persistence** : Add the ability to save high scores or player stats between sessions.
* **Multi-language Support** : Make the game accessible to a wider audience by localizing the text into different languages.
